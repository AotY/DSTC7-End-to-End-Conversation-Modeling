# Baseline settings

The baseline for this task is an LSTM-based seq2seq generation system. This model does not use grounding information ("facts"), as it is only meant to be a baseline. It is similar to the DSTC6 Task 2 baseline, which is available [(here)](https://github.com/dialogtekgeek/DSTC6-End-to-End-Conversation-Modeling/tree/master/ChatbotBaseline). Data to train this baseline will be made available [(here)](https://github.com/DSTC-MSR-NLP/DSTC7-End-to-End-Conversation-Modeling/tree/master/data_extraction).

**Under construction: A simple seq2seq baseline model implemented using Keras will be available shortly.**
