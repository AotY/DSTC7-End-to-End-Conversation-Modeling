# Baseline Model for DSTC7: End-to-End Conversation Modeling 

For the baseline, we consider the task without "facts" input. Then it is similar to the task in DSTC6, so you can use the following settings:
* Model: the previous model from DSTC6 [link](https://github.com/dialogtekgeek/DSTC6-End-to-End-Conversation-Modeling/tree/master/ChatbotBaseline)
* Data: the current DSTC7 dataset [link](https://github.com/DSTC-MSR-NLP/DSTC7-End-to-End-Conversation-Modeling/tree/master/data_extraction)
